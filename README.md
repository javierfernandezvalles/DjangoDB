# DjangoDB

Welcome to the Database Class project!

We chose to build this project using Django 2.0.4 Framework with Python 3.6
The reasons are simple -- it's super easy to set up a platform
for data from the database to display on the web! 

This allowed us for a quick set-up and allow to focus on the presentation.

Here is an overview of the instructions:

Section 1. Installing all Requirements
Section 2. Running a Django Project


# Section 1 
You will need to first install pip version 10.0.1, and python 3.6.3 on your computer.
After that, you should type the following in the command line:
'''
pip install requirements.txt
'''
